# Loom Verification Matrix

**Purpose:** Every correctness claim Loom makes — its test coverage, verification level, 
Rust ecosystem backing, and known gaps. This is the authoritative scorecard.

**Verification Levels (ascending rigour):**
| Level | Symbol | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| Parse/emit | 🔵 | The syntax parses and emits Rust that compiles |
| Checker | 🟡 | The static checker rejects violations |
| Runtime binary | 🟢 | The emitted binary runs and behaves correctly |
| Property (edge) | 🟢+ | Edge-case loop over boundary inputs passes |
| Property (random) | 🟠 | proptest random sampling — NOT YET integrated |
| Formal | 🔴 | Kani / Z3 symbolic exhaustion — NOT YET integrated |
| Community | ⚫ | Rust ecosystem crate with peer-reviewed correctness |

## Pillar 1 — Behavioral Correctness (Design by Contract)

| Claim | Loom Syntax | Emitted Rust | Tests | Verified | Ecosystem | Gaps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Preconditions enforced at runtime** | `require: n > 0` | `debug_assert!((n > 0), ...)` | `e2e_test::v1_contracts_emit_compilable_rust` `e2e_test::v1_violated_precondition_panics` | 🟢 binary panics with right message | [`contracts` crate](https://crates.io/crates/contracts) [`design_by_contract`](https://crates.io/crates/design_by_contract) | Release builds: `debug_assert` is stripped. Need `assert!` mode for release contracts. |
| **Postconditions on return value** | `ensure: result > n` | `let _loom_result = ...; debug_assert!(...)` | `e2e_test::v1_ensure_contract_fires_on_return_value` | 🟢 binary passes for valid case | same | No test for postcondition violation path (result violates ensure). |
| **Invariants on property blocks** | `property: forall x: Int, x = x` | `#[test] fn property_...(){ edge_cases loop; assert!(...) }` | `e2e_test::v3_property_test_runs_over_edge_cases` `m109_test::test_m109_property_emits_test_stub` | 🟢+ edge-case binary passes | [`proptest`](https://crates.io/crates/proptest) [`quickcheck`](https://crates.io/crates/quickcheck) | Only 7 boundary values. No random sampling. proptest crate not yet integrated. |

Runtime vector length not checked. |
| **Gradual typing (blame tracking)** | `gradual block ... end` | blame annotations in comments | `gradual_test` (5 tests) | 🔵 emit | [`miette`](https://crates.io/crates/miette) for error display | Blame labels not wired to runtime panics. |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Separation logic (ownership)** | `owns x; disjoint x y; frame {x}` | checker annotations → comments | `separation_test` (15 tests) | 🟡 checker | Rust borrow checker is the native impl; [`creusot`](https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot) for formal | Emitted Rust relies on Rust's borrow checker. Loom checker adds cross-domain ownership checks. No formal proof output. |
| **Side-channel safety** | `timing_safety: constant_time` | constant-time assertions in comments | `sidechannel_test` (6 tests) | 🟡 checker | [`subtle`](https://crates.io/crates/subtle) crate for ct operations | No binary test. `subtle` crate not yet imported in emitted code. |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Distribution typing** | `distribution: Normal(mu, sigma)` | distribution annotations | `probabilistic_test` (10 tests) | 🟡 checker | [`statrs`](https://crates.io/crates/statrs) | No runtime sampling test. Distributions not wired to statrs at codegen. |

## Canonical Experiments Reference

Community experiments that independently validate Loom's claims exist in `experiments/`.

| File | Claim tested | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `experiments/verification/v1_contracts.loom` | require:/ensure: fire at runtime | ✅ V1 verified |
| `experiments/verification/v3_property_tests.loom` | property: emits edge-case test | ✅ V3 verified |

## How to Add a New Claim

1. Add a row to the relevant Pillar table above.
2. Write the Loom syntax example.
3. Identify the emitted Rust.
4. Write the test (unit, e2e binary, or property) and link it.
5. Record the verification level symbol.
6. Add an experiment file in `experiments/verification/` with a human-readable claim spec.
7. Record any Rust ecosystem crate that independently validates the same property.
8. Document known gaps honestly.

**A claim with only 🔵 parse/emit is a declaration, not a proof.**
The goal is to get every correctness-critical claim to 🟢 or higher.
