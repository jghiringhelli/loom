## Current Context
- Branch: `docs/lineage-collapsed-loop` (2 commits ahead of origin, pushed)
- All 576 tests passing
- Bug fixes this session: evolve search parser `when` greediness, correctness_report keyword tokens

## Next Steps
1. **publish-merge**: Merge `docs/lineage-collapsed-loop` → `main`, then `cargo publish loom-lang v0.1.0`
2. arXiv submission: BIOISO convergence paper (`docs/bioiso-loom-convergence.md`)
3. Fix GitHub Actions (they were cluttering inbox — review `.github/workflows/`)
